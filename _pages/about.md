Hello, I am Xinyu Yang, you can call me Christopher/Chris, a first-year master student at [KU Leuven](https://lstat.kuleuven.be/) majoring in statistics. Before that, I complete double majors in [economics](https://econet.zjgsu.edu.cn/) and [statistics](http://tjjy.zjgsu.edu.cn/) from Zhejiang Gongshang University, where I was under the supervision of Prof. [Bu Zhou](http://tjjy.zjgsu.edu.cn/show.asp?newid=6969) exploring the field of nonparametric statistics, especially on functional data. 

Now, My research focus on causal machine learning, and I am open to any collaboration, especially with intersection to LLM.
